  <p>
   ImageDecoderFramework.js is a Javascript library for heavy decoding of images which are decoded
   by custom logic. It was designed especially to show the images in a web viewer like Cesium or
   Leaflet, besides an API that supports image decoding for wide applicative needs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The main advantages of using the library over implementing your image directly on top of one of
   the popular viewers API (e.g. Cesium's ImageryProvider or Leaflet's layers) are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Heavy use of Web Workers, which allow better interactivity.</li>
   <li>Support progressive fetch of gradually improved quality.</li>
   <li>An intermediate level between image implementation and viewer: Once an image is implemented, it may
       be used easily in both Leaflet and Cesium. Moreover, once implemented a plugin for your favorite
       viewer you may use it for any image.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once an image is implemented, the API of using it (for example to show part of it in HTML page or put
   it on a viewer) is relatively simple. However implementing the underlying image requires training on
   the API. In addition, the spatial calculations of the exact data to be fetched and pixels to be drawn
   on decode may be unintuitive without some experience with viewer infrastructure implementations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the library requires the following script imports:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-markup">   &lt;script src="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js">&lt;/script>
   &lt;script src="Cesium-1.20/Cesium.js">&lt;/script>&lt;!-- downloaded locally -->
   &lt;script src="http://MaMazav.github.io/cdn/image-decoder-framework.dev.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

  <h2>Image Implementation Overview</h2>
  <p>
   An image requires implementing a top-level Image class for all internal implementation. The
   image should hold three other classes that together implement the image functionality:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Fetcher - fetches the image parameters and the image data from server.</li>
   <li>InputRetriever implementation for Dependency Workers - manages the Web Workers that perform the
       actual decoding. It should be implemented by the
       <a href="../dependency-workers.js">depdendency-workers.js</a> library API. If using
       <a href="#gridimagebase">gridimagebase</a> some of the dependency-workers.js requirements are already fulfilled.</li>
   <li>LevelCalculator - provides conversion between screen resolution and level index, for multiple
       resolution images.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Whereas manually implementing all the functionality of those classes gives a lot of power, it may be too
   complicated for simple images. The GridImageBase and FetcherBase classes that are explained below are
   recommended for simple image implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Notice that each object of these classes may live in another Web Worker. Thus all method arguments,
   method results and even exceptions should be serializable. You don't need to treat the serialization and
   manage the Web Workers, just make sure that all data supports
   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#Things_that_don't_work_with_structured_clones">
   structured clones</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let's look on a simple example. This example shows an image that contains some resolution levels. Each
   resolution level is splitted into rectangular tiles (as in a standard "pyramid" - a common technique in
   the area of graphic viewers). The image is blue except of the tile borders which are cyan.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
  <a name="gridfetcherbase"></a>
  <h3>GridFetcherBase</h3>
  <p>
   First we need to implement the Fetcher. Inheriting the GridFetcherBase is an easy way to create a fetcher
   that fits our purpose. It requires implementing of three methods: open, fetchTile and getImageParams. The
   open method is called once and should return a promise that successfully terminates when the image is ready.
   The fetchTile performs the actual fetch of a single tile within a specific resolution level. The
   getImageParams should return an object contains the parameters of the image. The image parameters object
   should be returned also in the open method Promise result.
  </p>
  <p>
   The image parameters should contain at least the following fields:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>imageLevel - a reference resolution level of the image. The reference level is used only for consistency
       of calculations (sizes returned by various methods of the image should be in terms of the reference level)
       and doesn't have any applicative meaning for viewers. To simplify calculation it's usually better to
       choose the best resolution level as a reference level.</li>
   <li>imageWidth, imageHeight - the size of the image, in terms of the imageLevel.</li>
   <li>numResolutionLevelsForLimittedViewer - count of resolution levels. Even if the image is dynamic and may
       adapt to any resolution, some viewers may not have the ability for that and you'll have to choose some
       limitation for the resolution level count.</li>
   <li>lowestQuality, highestQuality - An advanced feature that may be used to define progressive quality within
       a given resolution level (e.g. as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000">Jpeg2000</a>'s
       quality layers). A lot of image implementations doesn't need it, and may put here an arbitrary value.</li>
   <li>tileWidth, tileHeight - Single tile size, Required only for images that inherit GridFetcher and GridImage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Besides those arguments, additional arguments may be added to the image parameters object. The image parameters
   object is later passed to the image by the opened method (see below). Besides being a consistent way to pass this
   parameters, it also provides a way to pass this argument across Web Workers if the Fetcher and Image are not on
   same Web Worker.
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/grid-fetcher.js"></code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="gridimagebase"></a>
  <h3>GridImageBase</h3>
  <p>
   Now that we have a Fetcher implemented, we need the Image and DependencyWorkers classes. Fortunately the GridImageBase
   implements most of their functionality given that our image is a conventional grid-structured. We only need to
   implement two methods: The opened method which is called after the Fetcher.opened terminated successfully (don't forget
   to call the base's opened method!), and the getDecodeWorkerTypeOptions which returns the data required to initialize
   a Web Worker that decode a single tile (same Web Worker data required for the Web Workers in
   <a href="../dependency-workers.js">depdendency-workers.js</a> library).
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/grid-image.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Notice that we also overrode the getLevelCalcualtor. This method can optionally be overriden to change the default
   LevelCalculator behavior provided by the GridImage. The default implementation represents an image with infinite
   resolution levels, where each level is four times bigger than the previous level (two times for each axis). In that
   example we override the default behavior of the GridImage to show how we create a finite-resolution image. You also may
   choose to implement an absolutely different LevelsCalculator (see the default
   <a href="https://github.com/MaMazav/ImageDecoderFramework.js/blob/src/simple-fetcher/grid-level-calculator.js">GridLevelCalculator</a>
   implementation as an example).
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/limitted-grid-level-calculator.js"></code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="decoderworker"></a>
  <h3>Decoder Worker: Web Worker for actual decode</h3>
  <p>
   Finally we need the Web Worker implementation which actually decode a single tile:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/grid-decoder-worker.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   That's all! We have the implemented image. Now let's see how can you easily convert this code into a
   graphic view using Leaflet.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <a name="leaflet"></a>
  <h2>Showing image in Leaflet</h3>
  <div id="leafletContainerGrid"></div>
  <p>
   Using the following several lines, your image will be shown in leaflet:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/grid-leaflet-demo.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Notice that you the workersLimit argument is optional and has a default value of 5. This argument limits the
   count of Web Workers used for decoding (excluding the fetch Web Worker). We limitted it in this demo because
   this page contains four images, and too many Web Workers causes instability issues in mobile device browsers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Now that we've seen the whole picture of the simplest use of the image-decoder-framework.js library, we would
   like to extend our knowledge about additional features that the library allows.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <a name="sierpinski"></a>
  <h2>Another image: Sierpinski carpet</h3>
  <p>
   The following example is more complex example of an image which represents
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet">Sierpinski carpet</a> image. It uses a
   <a href="scripts/graphics-library.js">graphics library</a> which luckily supports by-region partial calculation
   of the Sierpinski squares coordinates (well, actually this "library" was written especially for this demo page...).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Sierpinski carpet image does not demonstrate a new feature of the framework. It is just another more complex
   reference example of the framework. In addition we will improve this example to demonstrate progressiveness later
   (please ignore the getLowestQuality and getHighestQuality methods now - as mentioned above, they are not effective
   without progressiveness support).
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="leaflet-image-decoder-demo.html">Leaflet Sierpinski ImageDecoder Demo</a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Top level image implementation of Sierpinski carpet:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinski-image.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Sierpinski carpet image fetcher implementation:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinski-fetcher.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Sierpinski decoder worker implementation:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinski-decoder-worker.js"></code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="progressive"></a>
  <h2>Progressive fetch</h3>
  <p>
   Assume you have a heavy image, which is hard to be loaded or decoded. However this image may be splitted
   into lower qualities, which allows showing a quick lower quality image until the better image will be
   shown. In this case you may find progressiveness a very useful feature. Unfortunately not all viewers
   support it easily.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imagine that calculating Sierpinski square positions is a very heavy task. (later 'll demonstrate it by
   adding 500ms delay). As we show squares of smaller size, the count of the square increases and the quality
   improves. Luckily again, the graphics library enable bounding the square size to lower value to
   improve performance over quality. Let's reimplement our fetcher to support progressive calculation of
   Sierpinski squares (the progressive version of Sierpinski carpet image inherits the simple one and
   overrides only the required changes for progressiveness):
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="leaflet-progressive-demo.html">Leaflet Progressive ImageDecoder Demo</a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The top level image implementation of Sierpinski carpet is slightly changed:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinski-progressive-image.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   The fetcher implementation, however, is more sensitive to progressiveness:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinski-progressive-fetcher.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   The quality does not affect the decoder worker which only takes a list of squares as an input (although
   there may be cases in which the worker implementation should be changed to support progressiveness).
  </p>

  <hr>
  <a name="cesium"></a>
  <h2>Showing image in Cesium</h3>
  <p>
   The natural way to implement an image in Cesium is to implement an
   <a href="https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Documentation/ImageryProvider.html">ImageryProvider</a>. This
   API has a lot of advantages like natural integration into Cesium, tile caching, etc. However this API
   does not support progressiveness. We provide the two alternatives: CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager is an
   implementation which support progressiveness, and ImageDecoderImageryProvider which is more stable and
   enjoys other Cesium's ImageryProvider advantages if you don't care about progressiveness:
  </p>
  <h3>CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager</h4>
  <p>
   <a href="cesium-layer-manager-demo.html">CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager Demo</a>
  </p>
  <p>
   (In new Cesium versions we have a serious blinking issue, hope to solve it soon).
  </p>
  <p>
   The code behind showing an image in Cesium (given that the image is already implemented as above):
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/cesium-layer-manager-demo.js"></code></pre>
  <!----------->
  <h3>ImageDecoderImageryProvider</h4>
  <p>
   The API of ImageDecoderImageryProvide is more similar to the standard Cesium API than the
   CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager demonstrated above. However, one point which is counter-intuitive is the fact
   that ImageDecoderImageryProvider requires its parent viewer or widget as the constructor parameter. The
   reason is performance: Cesium tends to request a lot of tiles, especially when the user moves quickly but
   also for prefetch reasons. It may significantly degrade performance in the context of heavy decoding images.
   Thus the framework uses scheduling mechanism to prioritize and even abort some requests. The framework uses
   the information about the current view area for this prioritization, thus it needs the viewer.
  </p>
  <p>

  <a name="imagedecoder"></a>
  <h2>Programmatically get pixels of region in image</h3>
  <p>
   Until now we saw only high level interfaces for using the image with Leaflet and Cesium viewers. One can
   also use the ImageDecoder class to get the pixels programmatically and do it whatever he would like. The
   following example demonstrate how to decode a region of interest from the image and use it within a simple
   canvas (click on the button below the code to activate the demo):
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/image-decoder-demo.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" value="Show image!" onclick="decodeRegionByImageDecoder()">
  <br><br>
  <canvas id="imageDecoderDemoCanvas"></canvas>

  <hr>
  <a name="viewerimagedecoder"></a>
  <h2>Showing image in arbitrary viewer</h3>
  <p>
   Besides the ImageDecoder demonstrated above, there is also API which is more optimized for viewers. The
   class ViewerImageDecoder will manage a canvas for you, including caching already-rendered regions, canvas
   resizing, and always rendering low-resolution image in the back to avoid empty areas blinkin. You only
   need to let the ViewerImageDecoder know when and where the viewer moves, and update the canvas position
   according to the ViewerImageDecoder callbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The example below shows how to use the image with a super simple viewer implemented in the graphics
   library (same graphics library mentioned above which was written for this demo).
