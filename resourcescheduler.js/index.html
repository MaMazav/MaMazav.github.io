   ResourceScheduler.js is a Javascript library for tasks scheduling. Useful for sue-cases of tasks
   that require a lot of resource like CPU, network bandwidth, etc. The library is espacially useful
   for tasks which can be prioritized.

  <h3>Creating a scheduler</h3>
  
  <p>
   To begin the work with the ResourceScheduler.js library, include <a href="scripts/resourcescheduler.js">
   resourcescheduler.js</a> script in your page. Then you have two types of scheduler available: LifoScheduler
   and PriorityScheduler.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The most simplest scheduler to use is LifoScheduler. It just schedule the most recent job in queue when it
   has an available resource. The LifoScheduler constructor accepts two mandatory arguments:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a name="createresource"></a>
    createResource - a non-parametric function that returns a resource. On the beginning of the execution,
    when new jobs are to be scheduled but resources has not been allocated yet, the LifoScheduler will use this
    function to create the resources.
   </li>
   <li>
    jobsLimit - count of available resources (i.e. maximum amount of parallel jobs).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The LifoScheduler is useful if jobs do not have special priority over each other, and you just want to limit
   the amount of parallel jobs.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
   var scheduler = new LifoScheduler(
     function createResource() {
       return new DbConnection();
     },
     /*jobsLimit=*/4);
  </code></pre>

  <p>
   The PriorityScheduler is a more complicated scheduler. It schedules the job accoding to some priority defined
   by the user. Its constructor accepts three mandatory arguments:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    createResource - as in LifoScheduler.
   </li>
   <li>
    jobsLimit - as in LifoScheduler.
   </li>
   <li>
    prioritizer - an object contains getPriority method. We will demonstrate it in the <a href="#prioritizer">
    prioritizer</a> section.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In addition, a fourth optional argument can contain more options. They will be discussed in the
   <a href="#priorityscheduleroptions">PriorityScheduler options</a> section.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <a name="enqueuejob"></a>
  <h3>Enqueue job to scheduler</h3>
  <p>
   After creating a scheduler, we can request the scheduler to schedule a job. Enqueueing a job is performed by
   calling the function enqueueJob with three arguments which declare the job:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    jobFunc - a function which actually performs the job. The function should accept two arguments - a resource
	(created by the <a href="#createresource">createResource</a> function) and the jobContext passed as the second
	argument.
   </li>
   <li>
    jobContext - an object declaring the specific job. The job context is used only by the jobFunc - the scheduler
	doesn't care about its content. If the jobFunc has enough information information to execute the job and it doesn't
	need the job context, this argument may be even ignored.
   </li>
   <li>
    jobAbortedFunc - a function that will be called if the job has been <a href="#abort">aborted</a> before scheduling.
	This argument is also not mandatory, if the job may not be aborted.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The secheduler holds the jobFunc and jobContext until the jobFunc is executed. Right after executing the function, the
   scheduler has no information about the executed job until either <a href="#finishjob">finishJob</a> or
   <a href="#yield">yield</a> functions are called.
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>
   scheduler.enqueueJob(
     function jobFunc(dbConnection, jobContext) {
       var result = dbConnection.executeQuery(jobContext.sql);
       jobContext.callback(result);
     },
     /*jobContext=*/{
       sql: 'Select Name from Employees where salary > 5000',
	   table: 'Employees',
       callback: function(employees) {
         console.log('Got ' + employees.length + ' employees');
       }
   );
  </code></pre>

  <hr>
  <a name="finishjob"></a>
  <h3>Finishing a job and release resource</h3>
  <p>
   Once the job is done, the jobFunc is expected to return the resource back to the scheduler so the scheduler know it is
   released and more jobs may be scheduled. It is done by calling the finishJob function.
  </p>
  <p>
   The finishJob function accepts also a second argument of the jobContext. However, in the usual scenario it is not a mandatory
   argument; the jobContext is used only when showLog option is true in the <a href="#priorityscheduleroptions">PriorityScheduler
   constructor</a> and is used only to log the priority of the job.
  </p>
  <p>
   After calling the finishJob function, the resource should not be used anymore as it may be passed to another job for its use.
  </p>
  
  <pre><code>
   scheduler.enqueueJob(
     function jobFunc(dbConnection, jobContext) {
       var result = dbConnection.executeQuery(jobContext.sql);
       scheduler.finishJob(dbConnection, jobContext);
       jobContext.callback(result);
     },
     /*jobContext=*/{
       sql: 'Select Name from Owners where stocks >= 51',
	   table: 'Owners',
       callback: function(owners) {
         console.log('Got ' + owners.length + ' owners');
       }
   );
  </code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="yield"></a>
  <h3>Yielding a resource</h3>
  <p>
   A job may decide to yield the resource in favour of higher priority jobs. To do that, simply call the tryYield function.
   The possible responses of the scheduler are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The scheduler may decide to not yield the resource but let it continue running. In such situation the tryYield function
    will return false (This is the only possible response of the LifoScheduler).
   </li>
   <li>
    The scheduler may decide to yield the job. Then the jobYieldedFunc callback will be executed, and the job is re-enqueued
	with the jobContinueFunc and jobAbortedFunc for later scheduling. After the jobYieldedFunc called, the resource should
	not be used anymore. Notice that the later jobContinueFunc function may be passed a different resource. The new resource
	is the only one that should be used.
   </li>
   <li>
    The scheduler may decide to abort the job (see <a href="#abort">Using prioritizer to abort waiting jobs</a>). Then the
	jobAbortedFunc callback will be executed. After the jobAbortedFunc called, the resource should not be used anymore. 
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Notice that even if the jobYieldedFunc was called, the later call to jobContinueFunc (or jobAbortedFunc in case of abort)
   may be called before the tryYield function has been returned. It may happen if other jobs scheduled during the tryYield
   function has been finished immediately. For that reason, it is not recommended to perform any operation related to the job
   after the tryYield function. Instead pass those operations to the end of the jobYieldedFunc callback.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tryYield function accepts five arguments: the four mentioned callbacks and the resource passed in the jobFunc:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    jobContinueFunc - a callback to execute when the function is rescheduled (after yielded). Its argument are identical to
	the jobFunc function passed to the <a href="#enqueuejob">enqueueJob</a> function.
   </li>
   <li>jobContext - the context of the job.</li>
   <li>
    jobAbortedFunc - a callback to execute if the job is aborted. Identical to the jobAbortedFunc passed to the
    <a href="#enqueuejob">enqueueJob</a> function.
   </li>
   <li>jobYieldedFunc - a callback to execute if the job is yielded. It is passed only a single argument - the jobContext.</li>
   <li>
    resource - the resource originally passed to the jobFunc function that was passed to the <a href="#enqueuejob">enqueueJob</a>
    function.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <a name="prioritizer"></a>
  <h3>Implementing prioritizer for PriorityScheduler</h3>
  <p>
   If the various jobs have different priorities, one can use the PriorityScheduler. The constructor of the PriorityScheduler
   accepts a third argument, prioritizer, which is an object contains a getPriority method. This method accepts the job context
   as an argument and returns the job's priority, which is a non-negative number. As higher the number, as higher the job priority.
   The priority of a given job may change over time. Notice that a large number of priorities is not recommended, as it may
   degrade performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, the following prioritizer may match to the jobs demonstrated in the above snippets. The PriorityScheduler which
   accepts the following prioritizer will schedule queries from table 'Owners' before queries from table 'Employees':
  </p>
  <pre><code>
   var scheduler = new PriorityScheduler(
     function createResource() {
       return new DbConnection();
     },
     /*jobsLimit=*/4,
     /*prioritizer=*/ { getPriority: function(jobContext) {
        switch (jobContext.table) {
          case 'Employees':
            return 1;
          case 'Owners':
            return 2;
          default:
            return 0;
        }
     });
  </code></pre>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="priorityscheduleralg"></a>
  <h3>PriorityScheduler's Scheduling algorithm</h3>
  <p>
   First, it is important to understand that the PriorityScheduler does not guarantee to schedule high priority jobs first. The
   scheduler should improve performance, thus it is limited to perform short and efficient operations regularly. For the scenario
   we used the PriorityScheduler, we found it useful enough to compare the priorities of only the last enqueued jobs and schedule
   one of them (the number of the new enqueued jobs considered is controlled by the option argument
   <a href="#numnewjobs">numNewJobs</a>). If you have a different scenario you are invited to contribute support of another behaviour.
   Older jobs are scheduled only after the new ones has been scheduled, or after a "rerank" is performed (see below).
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, if the priority of jobs change over time, then the probability that highest priority job will be scheduled first is
   decreased. For performance reason the PriorityScheduler sorts the jobs when enqueued and do not recalculate priorities of jobs
   that their priorities were already calculated as low (that's true for old jobs only; for the new jobs, as described in the previous
   paragraph, the priority is recalculated each time that a resource is freed).
  </p>
  <p>
   To partially overcome some problems raised because of the above mentioned behaviour, the PriorityScheduler performs "rerank" of
   priorities after some jobs have been scheduled. The "rerank" recalculates priorities of all jobs in the system, and takes the highest
   priority jobs to be the "newest jobs" so they will be scheduled first. The time to perform "rerank" is determined by the number of
   scheduled jobs and may be controlled by the <a href="#numJobsBeforeRerankOldPriorities">numJobsBeforeRerankOldPriorities</a> argument.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the PriorityScheduler may not schedule low priority jobs even if a resource is free and no higher priority jobs exist. It may
   happen if the programmer chose that higher priority jobs will always be guaranteed free resources. In such situation, lower priority job
   will be scheduled only if after scheduling there will still be enough free resources waiting for potential higher priority jobs. This
   option is controlled by the <a href="#resourcesGuaranteedForHighPriority"></a> and <a href="#highPriorityToGuaranteeResource"></a> options.
   This mechanism is not active by default (Values of zero in those options implicitly cause it to be inactive).
  </p>

  <a name="priorityscheduleroptions"></a>
  <h3>PriorityScheduler options</h3>
  <p>
   The fourth argument of the PriorityScheduler constructor, is an option object that may contain the following properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a name="showlog"></a>
    showLog - Boolean. Determines if to show log to the console. Defaults to false.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a name="schedulername"></a>
    schedulerName - String. A scheduler name to show in the log messages (effective only if showLog = true).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a name="numnewjobs"></a>
    numNewJobs - Number. Determines the number of the new jobs which are to be scheduled first (see
	<a href="#priorityscheduleralg">PriorityScheduler's Scheduling algorithm</a> section). Defaults to 20.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a name="numjobsbeforererankoldpriorities"></a>
    numJobsBeforeRerankOldPriorities - Number. Determines how many jobs will be scheduled before a "rerank"
	will be performed (see <a href="#priorityscheduleralg">PriorityScheduler's Scheduling algorithm</a>
	section). Defaults to 20.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a name="resourcesguaranteedforhighpriority"></a>
    resourcesGuaranteedForHighPriority - Number. Determines the amount of resources to guarantee for potential
	high priority jobs (see <a href="#priorityscheduleralg">PriorityScheduler's Scheduling algorithm</a>
	section). Defaults to 0.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a name="highprioritytoguaranteeresource"></a>
    highPriorityToGuaranteeResource - Number. The minimal priority to guarantee resources for. Defaults to 0.
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="abort"></a>
  <h3>Using prioritizer to abort waiting jobs</h3>
  <p>
   To cause a job to be aborted, the prioritizer just need to return a negative value in the getPriority function
   when accepting the requested job.
  </p>
  <p>
   A job which has already been scheduled may not be aborted. Only jobs that are waiting for scheduling may be
   aborted. Jobs which have been yielded and waiting for rescheduling may also be aborted.
