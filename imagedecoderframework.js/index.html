  <p>
   ImageDecoderFramework.js is a Javascript library for heavy decoding of images which are decoded
   by custom logic. It was designed especially to show the images in a web viewer like Cesium or
   Leaflet. However it contains API also for general purpose image decoder.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The main advantages of using the library over implementing your image on one of the popular viewers
   API (e.g. Cesium's ImageryProvider or Leaflet's layers) are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Heavy use of Web Workers, which allow better interactivity.</li>
   <li>Support in progressive fetch of gradually improved quality.</li>
   <li>An intermediate level between image implementation and viewer: Once an image is implemented, it may
       be used easily in both Leaflet and Cesium. Moreover, once implemented a plugin for your favorite
       viewer you may use it for any image.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once an image is implemented, the API of using it (for example to show part of it in HTML page or put
   it on a viewer) is relatively simple. However implementing the underlying image requires getting used of
   the structure of the image, which should handle with splitting the work between Web Workers. In addition,
   the spatial calclations of the exact data to be fetched and pixels to be drawn on decode may be
   unintuitive without some experience with viewer infrastructure implementations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the library requires the following script imports:
  </p>
  <pre><code>   &lt;script src="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js">&lt;/script>
   &lt;script src="Cesium-1.20/Cesium.js">&lt;/script>&lt;!-- downloaded locally -->
   &lt;script src="http://MaMazav.github.io/cdn/image-decoder-framework.dev.js">&lt;/script>

  <h3>Implementing an image</h3>
  <p>
   An image requires implementating four classes. Each object of these classes may live in another Web Worker.
   Thus all method arguments, method results and even exceptions should be serializable. You don't need to
   treat its serialization and manage the Web Workers, just make sure that all data support
   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#Things_that_don't_work_with_structured_clones">
   structured clones</a>.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Fetcher - fetches the image parameters and the image data from server. A single fetcher instance is
       created for each image instance and it lives in its own Web Worker.</li>
   <li>PixelsDecoder - performs the decoding of the fetched data and converting it into pixels. There may
       be some decoders for a single image instance and each one lives in its own Web Worker.</li>
   <li>ImageParamsRetreiver - a lightweight object which accepts the image parameters fetched by the Fetcher
       and expose them in the ImageDecoderFramework API methods. ImageParamsRetreiver instances will be
       created and used by the framework as auxiliary classes near the Fetcher and PixelDecoders.</li>
   <li>ImageImplementation - the entry point of creating an image. It contains factory methods for creating
       instances of the classes mentioned above. In addition it tells the framework which scripts should be
       imported on other Web Workers to instantiate and use your image. Similarly to ImageParamsRetreiver,
       the ImageImplementation should also be reachable by all Web Workers.
  </ol>
  <p>
   Let's look on a simple example. This example shows an image that contains some resolution levels. Each
   resolution level is splitted into rectangular tiles (as in a standard "pyramid" - a common technique in
   the area of graphic viewers). The image is blue except of the tile borders which are cyan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most simple way to implement an image is using SimpleFetcher and SimplePixelsDecoder. It contains a
   key-based mechanism for splitting the image data into parts, like tiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, we will implement two "beurocratical" classes: The ImageParamsRetreiver and the ImageImplementation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ImageImplementation is the entry point of creating an image. It contains three factory methods: Two of
   them, for creating PixelsDecoder and ImageParamsRetreiver are regular factory methods. The third method,
   "createFetcher", is the first called method for a given image instance. It opens the image by a given URL
   and returns asynchronously (promise-based) a Fetcher object and a sizeParams data object. This sizeParams
   structure is up to your decision and it will be passed later to ImageParamsRetreiver instances. Just make
   sure that the sizeParams is serializable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides the factory methods, the image implementation should also provide a list of script files to be
   imported on the other Web Workers in the system. These files should contain all code needed for allocating
   and using the image parts. If you are not familiar with Web Worker, just imagine that this scripts are
   included in a new HTML page, and think about all dependent scripts that should be loaded in order this
   script to work there properly.
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/gridimageimplementation.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Now let's define the ImageParamsRetreiver. It is only an API for the framework to query about the image
   parameters. It contains the following methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>getNumResolutionLevelsForLimittedViewer - Some viewers' API (like Cesium's ImageryProvider) requires
       to provide the count of the resolution levels in the image prior to its rendering. This method is for
       them.</li>
   <li>getImageLevel - This level will be used as the best level for limitted viewers (see previous method).
       In addition, the framework will later use this level as a reference level when indicating a region in
       the image (see method getLevel). The calculations below assumes that each level contains pixels count
       which is four times the number of pixels of its ancestor level (two times each axis).</li>
   <li>getLevelWidth, getLevelHeight - returns the number of the pixels in the width or the height of a given
       level.</li>
   <li>getLevel - given a screen size and region in the image (in coordinates of the image level - see
       getImageLevel above), this method should tell the framework which level should be used to show this
       region.</li>
   <li>getLowestQuality, getHighestQuality - for progressiveness. In this stage you may return here any value
       you would like to</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/gridimageparamsretriever.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Now let's go to the implementation of the two core parts of the image: the Fetcher and the PixelsDecoder.
   Given that you decided using SimpleFetcher and SimplePixelsDecoder (the only option you know right now :)
   ), you should decide how to split the image. The fetcher requires providing the following methods:
   <ul>
    <li>getDataKeys - calculates the keys needed for a given region in the image.</li>
    <li>fetch - actually fetches a single tile.</li>
    <li>getHashCode and isEqual - auxiliary methods for the framework to efficiently treat the image keys.
        </li>
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/gridfetcher.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   The fetched data will be passed to a PixelsDecoder, which in turn will accept requests to decode a given
   region and key.
  </p>
  <p>
   Notice that the framework tries to optimize the fetch and decode requests for maximal reuse. Thus the
   PixelsDecoder should support decoding of partial region. You should calculate the intersection between the
   data related with the given key, and the region requested by the framework.
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/gridpixelsdecoder.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   That's all! now you have an implemented image. Now let's see how can you easily convert this code into a
   graphic view using your favorite viewer, like Leaflet or Cesium.

  <h3>Showing image in Leaflet</h3>
  <div id="leafletContainerGrid"></div>
  <p>
   Using the following several lines, your image will be shown in leaflet:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/gridleafletdemo.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Notice that you the workersLimit argument is optional and has a default value of 5. This argument limits the
   count of Web Workers used for decoding (excluding the fetch Web Worker). I limitted it in this demo because
   this page contains four images, and too many Web Workers causes instability issues in mobile device browsers.
  </p>

  <h3>Another image: Sierpinski carpet</h3>
  <p>
   The following example is more complex example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet">
   sierpinski carpet</a> image. It uses a <a href="scripts/graphicslibrary.js">graphics library</a> which luckily
   supports by-region partial calculation of the sierpinski squares coordinates (well, actually this "library" was
   written especially for this demo page...).
  </p>
  <p>
   The sierpinski carpet image does not demonstrate a new feature of the framework. It is just another more complex
   reference example of the framework. In addition we will improve this example to demonstrate progressiveness later
   (please ignore the getLowestQuality and getHighestQuality methods now - as mentioned above, they are not effective
   without progressiveness support).
  </p>
  <p>

  <hr>
  <a name="progressive"></a>
  <h3>Progressive fetch</h3>
  <p>
   Assume you have a heavy image, which is hard to be loaded or decoded. However this image may be splitted
   into lower qualities, which allows showing a quick lower quality image until the better image will be
   shown. In this case you may find progressiveness a very useful feature. Unfortunately not all viewers
   support it easily.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imagine that calculating sierpinski square positions is a very heavy task. (later we'll demonstrate it by
   adding 500ms delay). As we show squares of smaller size, the count of the square increases and the quality
   improves. Luckily again, the graphics library enable bounding the square size to a minimal value to
   improve performance over quality. Let's reimplement our fetcher to support progressive calculation of
   sierpinski squares (notice the signature of fetchProgressive method, which should be implemented instead
   of the non progressive fetch method):
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="leafletprogressivedemo.html">Leaflet Progressive ImageDecoder Demo</a>
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinskiprogressivefetcher.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   The quality is transparent to the PixelsDecoder which only takes a list of squares as an input (although
   there may be cases in which the PixelsDecoder implementation should be changed to support progressiveness).
   The ImageParamsRetreiver however should be aware of quality - it should implement the getLowestQuality and
   getHighestQuality methods so the framework will be able to limit fetch quality and optimize the view (see
   ImageParamsRetreiver implementation above).
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, just fix the script file and class name to those of the SierpinskiProgressiveFetcher, and we got the
   progressive version of the sierpinski carpet you can see at the top of the page:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sierpinskiprogressiveimageimplementation.js"></code></pre>

  <a name="cesium"></a>
  <h3>Showing image in Cesium</h3>
  <p>
   The natural way to implement an image in Cesium is to implement an
   <a href="https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Documentation/ImageryProvider.html">ImageryProvider</a>. This
   API has a lot of advantages like natural integration into Cesium, tile caching, etc. However this API
   does not support progressiveness. We provide the two alternatives: CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager is an
   implementation which support progressiveness, and ImageDecoderImageryProvider which is more stable and
   enjoys other Cesium's ImageryProvider advantages if you don't care about progressiveness:
  </p>
  <h4>CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager</h4>
  <p>
   <a href="cesiumlayermanagerdemo.html">CesiumImageDecoderLayerManager Demo</a>
  </p>
  <p>
   (In new Cesium versions we have a serious blinking issue, hope to solve it soon).
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/cesiumlayermanagerdemo.js"></code></pre>
  <!----------->
  <h4>ImageDecoderImageryProvider</h4>
  <p>
   One may be surprised about the fact that ImageDecoderImageryProvider requires its parent viewer or widget, as standard ImageryProviders
   do not require this. The reason is performance: Cesium tends to request a lot of tiles, especially when the user moves quickly but also
   for prefetch reasons. It may significantly degrade performance in the context of heavy decoding images. Thus the framework uses
   scheduling mechanism to prioritize and even abort some requests. The framework uses the information about the current view area for this
   prioritization, thus it needs the viewer.
  </p>

  <a name="imagedecoder"></a>
  <h3>Programmatically get pixels of region in image</h3>
  <p>
   Until now we saw only high level interfaces for using the image with Leaflet and Cesium viewers. One can
   also use the ImageDecoder class to get the pixels programmatically and do it whatever he would like. The
   following example demonstrate how to decode a region of interest from the image and use it within a simple
   canvas (click on the button below the code to activate the demo):
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/imagedecoderdemo.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" value="Show image!" onclick="decodeRegionByImageDecoder()">
  <br><br>
  <canvas id="imageDecoderDemoCanvas"></canvas>

  <hr>
  <a name="viewerimagedecoder"></a>
  <h3>Showing image in arbitrary viewer</h3>
  <p>
   Besides the ImageDecoder demonstrated above, there is also API which is more optimized for viewers. The
   class ViewerImageDecoder will manage a canvas for you. In case of move it will render only new regions
   instead of all screen, resize the canvas, copy the pixels and will show a low quality overview of the 
   image in the background to avoid blinking. You only need to let the ViewerImageDecoder know when and where
   the viewer moves, and update the canvas position according to the ViewerImageDecoder callbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The example below shows how to use the image with a super simple viewer implemented in the graphics
   library mentioned above.
