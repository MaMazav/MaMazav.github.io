  <h1>AsyncProxy Examples</h1>

  <div style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">PAGE IS STILL IN CONSTRUCTION</div>

  <p>
   AsyncProxy is a simple helper library enables migrating a whole javascript class to a web-worker.
   The library supports some simple use cases which will be detailed in this page.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="helloworld"></a>
  <h3>AsyncProxy Hello world!</h3>
  <p>
   The most simple use of AsyncProxy is to instantiate a class in a web worker and call its functions.  For that the
   AsyncProxy should be provided the following data:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>The script(s) including the required code in the Web Worker (absolute path only).</li>
   <li>Class name to instantiate.</li>
   <li>Class's relevant method description.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Assume we have a class named Callee in a script '/scripts/callee.js', that has a simple method helloWorld. In order
   to create a Proxy class for the Callee class you only need to provide the above information by using the following lines:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/async-proxy-hello-world.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   (One way to get an absolute path is using the getEntryUrl() function, which returns the absolute path of the source page.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The AsyncProxy library may be added to your page by:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="http://MaMazav.github.io/cdn/async-proxy.dev.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>
  <p>
   Let's demonstrate this basic usage by the following Callee class. The below Callee class will be used also in
   the rest of this page. For now, notice only the helloWorld() function which may take a lot of time:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/callee.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   Instantiating the Proxy and calling the helloWorld() from remote is easy as:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var proxy = new AsyncProxyHelloWorld({ helloWorldCtorArgument: 10000 });
proxy.helloWorld(50000);</code></pre>
  <p>
   Instantiating the AsyncProxyHelloWorld class will spawn an underlying Web Worker and call the Callee constructor there.
   Then, the call to proxy.helloWorld will activate the Callee.helloWorld method on the Web Worker.
  </p>
  <p>
   An alternative way to manage the imported scripts will be described in the section about
   <a href="#scriptstoimportpool">ScriptsToImportPool</a> class.
  </p>
  
  <input type="button" onclick="demoHelloWorld()" value="Hello world demo!">
  
  <p>
   Another equivalent way is to define the method by custom way:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/async-proxy-hello-world-custom.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   This code is equivalent to the one defined in async-proxy-hello-world, unless it is more customable. It may be useful
   for complex features that will be shown later.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <a name="subworkeremulation"></a>
  <h3>Sub-Worker emulation for Chrome</h3>
  <p>
   But what if the class already uses workers internally? It should be able to spawn its sub-workers although
   not supported at Chrome.
  <p>
  </p>
   Using AsyncProxy that's not a problem. The AsyncProxy library emulates sub-workers for Chrome seamlessly.
   Notice, however, that those workers are actually spawned from the main thread context, thus a communication
   overhead affects the UI also.
  </p>
  <p>
   Particularly, the proxied class can spawn sub-workers indirectly by using AsyncProxy library by itself, as
   in the callSubWorker() function of the Callee class above. The SubWorkerProxy class below defines the proxy
   method - by the same way we defined the simple hello world function: The sub-worker is supported transparently.
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/sub-worker-proxy.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoSubWorker()" value="Start Sub worker demo">
  
  <hr>
  <a name="arguments"></a>
  <h3>Passing special arguments and results</h3>
  <p>
   If the arguments and method result passed to and from the Web Worker are trivial, then defining method as above
   by "helloWorld: [ ]" is OK. However, in several cases a special treatment is needed for the arguments to be passed
   to or from the Web Worker:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    One-time callback argument - a function is not serializable. Special bookkeeping is required in order to pass
    callback calls from the Web Worker. Fortunately the async-proxy.js library can do that for you behind the scene.
    (see <a href="#customcallback">Custom Callback</a> section for details about customizing callbacks for multiple
    calls).
   </li>
   <li>
    Promise return value - Similarly to function arguments, the async-proxy.js library can simulate returning Promise
    by special bookkeeping.
   </li>
   <li>
    Transferables - To avoid copying of heavy objects when passing arguments to Web Worker proxied function,
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable">transferables</a> (also known as ports)
    can be used. Transferables are supported both in arguments and in a Promise result.
   </li>
   <li>
    Change call order - Sometimes massive function calls on Web Worker may take too long and block later function calls.
    If the later function calls are more important, they can be marked to be called immediately to bypass the earlier calls.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   AsyncProxyHelloWorldCustom class below demonstrates the above features API:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/async-proxy-methods.js"></code></pre>
  <p>
   The following code demonstrate calling these functions:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/demo-arguments.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoArguments()" value="Start passing arguments demo">

  <p>
   The custom equivalent way to define the above methods is below:
  </p>
  <a name="customarguments"></a>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/async-proxy-methods-custom.js"></code></pre>
  <!--
  <hr>
  <a name="promise"></a>
  <h3>Promise</h3>
  <p>
   If your function returns a value and you would like to migrate it to a worker, it should return it asynchronously,
   e.g. by using Promise. Given such a function, proxying it requires only adding <code>isReturnPromise</code> property
   to the options of the function call:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/promiseproxy.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoPromise()" value="Start Promise demo"><br><br>
  
  <hr>
  <a name="callback"></a>
  <h3>Callbacks</h3>
  <p>
   If you prefer using callbacks instead of Promise, you'll have to wrap the callback argument passed to the function using
   the <code>wrapCallback</code> function:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/callbackproxy.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoCallback()" value="Start Callback demo">
  <p>
   By default, the callback created by the <code>wrapCallback</code> function will be cleared right after the first use. Additional
   calls to the callback will raise an error. If you would like to use the callback multiple times, you should indicate it when
   wrapping the callback and clear it when not needed anymore:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/multiplecallbackproxy.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoMultipleCallback()" value="Start multiple-time Callback demo">
  -->
  <hr>
  <a name="termination"></a>
  <h3>Manual termination</h3>
  <p>
   Terminating the underlying Web Worker is as easy as calling to terminate() function. Notice that if you need to do some 
   release operations on the worker side when terminating the class (e.g. release resources, send information to server,
   etc.), you should wait for these operations to finish before calling to terminate(). In some use-cases Promise may be
   useful here.
  </p>
  <p>
   Function terminate() also closes all sub-workers (including those were spawned using Chrome sub-workers emulation as
   explained above).
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/terminate.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoTerminate()" value="Start terminate demo">
  
  <hr>
  <a name="customcallback"></a>
  <h3>Custom callback options</h3>
  <p>
   We previously demonstrated a simple callback. The callbacks require  the AsyncProxy library to save bookkeeping
   information in the Web Worker side in order to identify the original callback. By default this bookkeeping information
   is released after the first call to it, as stated above. If you would like to call the callback more than once you may
   change this behavior by customizing it as shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/custom-callback-proxy.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoCustomCallback()" value="Start custom callback demo">
  
  <!--
  <h3>Performance</h3>
  <hr>
  <a name="transferables"></a>
  <h4>Transferables</h4>
  <p>
   If you would like to avoid the overhead of copying buffers when sending to the worker, you can use transferables ("ports"). AsyncProxy
   supports three use-cases of transferables:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>When sending arguments to the worker</li>
   <li>When worker returns a promise result contains transferables</li>
   <li>When worker calls a callback with arguments contain transferables</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
   To send arguments with transferables, use the <code>transferables</code> property of options object:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/transferablestoworker.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoTransferablesToWorker()" value="Start transferables demo">
  
  <p>
   The other two uses requires to know the path to transferables in the returned values. For example, in promise you should use the
   <code>pathsToTransferablesInPromiseResult</code> property of options object:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/transferablesfrompromise.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoTransferablesFromPromise()" value="Start promise transferables demo">
  <p>
   Similarly you should know the paths to transferables when wrapping a callback:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/transferables-from-callback.js"></code></pre>
  <input type="button" onclick="demoTransferablesFromCallback()" value="Start callback transferables demo">
  
  <a name="buffersize"></a>
  <h4>Out of order urgent functions</h4>
  <p>
   Unlike simple function calls, calling to function of remote class allocated on web worker implies communication and time overhead.
   If a lot of function calls are performed, the message queue to the worker may contain a lot of messages and a new messages will
   take a time to arrive. If urgent messages need to wait for all the messages in queue to be sent it might degrade performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   On usual state, messages are sent according to the order of the <code>callFunction</code> calls. However if you have messages which
   are of top priority to arrive at the class, and calling them out of order will not hurt correctness, you can call them with the
   <code>argumentsAsArray</code> set to true.
  </p>
  <p>
   By default, the AsyncProxy library will not send more than 5 function calls simultaneously, and future calls will be waiting for
   previous calls to be sent. You can change the count of simultaneous function calls by setting the <code>functionsBufferSize</code>
   property of the options object.
  </p>
  
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/urgent-functions.js"></code></pre>
  
  <p>
   The client code of the demo below is:

  <hr>
  
  <a name="slavesidefeatures"></a>
  <h3>Slave-side features</h3>
  <p>
   On all the cases mentioned above we didn't write any slave-side code (a code that is executed on the Web Worker), except of the proxied
   class itself. One may want to inject a slave-side code without changing the slave class implementation. The features in this section
   allows you to do so.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <h4>Custom creation of slave side instance</h4>
  <p>
   Until now we've seen a simple way to control the instance created on the slave side. The creation was done by passing a string indicates
   the class constructor name, and arguments array. If you would like to execute some logic in the slave side before
   creating the instance you need an additional 
  </p>
  <p>
   The setSlaveSideCreator allows you to do that - instead of defining a class which its instance will be created, you can provide a factory
   function which will create your instance using any logic you would like to and actually enables to define any way you would like to
   instantiate the class.
  </p>

  <p>
   The slave-side script should call the setSlaveSideCreator function:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/custom-creation-slave.js"></code></pre>
  
  <p>
   The master-side proxy definition should indicate that the above script is needed to be imported on the slave side:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/custom-creation-master.js"></code></pre>
  
  <input type="button" onclick="demoCustomCreation()" value="Start custom creation demo">
  
  <hr>
  <h4>Sending user data from slave to master</h4>
  <p>
   Until now, the only option to send data from slave to master is by using callback arguments sent by the master or by Promises.
   It means that the master should initiate an action to allow the slave to send data. The <code>sendUserDataToMaster</code>
   overcomes it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The slave only need to send the data whenever he would like to:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/user-data-slave.js"></code></pre>
  
  <p>
   The master can listen and receive the sent data by setting a handler for this:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/user-data-master.js"></code></pre>
  
  <input type="button" onclick="demoUserData()" value="Start user-data demo">
  
  <hr>
  <h4>setBeforeOperationListener</h4>
  <p>
   The slave is able to listen events happen on its side. It is done by providing a listener function to
   <code>setBeforeOperationListener</code> method.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <code>this</code> argument of the function is the slave side instance (either created automatically or by setSlaveSideCreator function).
   The first argument that the listener function accepts is the event type. Currently the only possible event type is 'callback', and it will
   be called before any time a callback is called by the slave instance. In case of callback the second argument of the listener function is
   the callback name as was defined by the call to <a href="#customarguments">wrapCallback</a>, and the third argument is the arguments passed
   to the callback.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contribution is welcome - it is easy to extends the AsyncProxy.js implementation to support more types of events.
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/before-operation-listener-slave.js"></code></pre>
  
  <input type="button" onclick="demoSetBeforeOperationListener()" value="Start before-operation-listener demo">
  
  <a name="scriptstoimportpool"></a>
  <hr>
  <h3>ScriptsToImportPool class</h4>
  <p>
   An alternative of passing the absolute paths of each imported script is using the ScriptsToImportPool class. This approach is useful if the
   imported scripts are already used in the master side. You can instantiate this class and call the <code>addScriptFromErrorWithStackTrace</code>
   method from each script you would like to import. Then use the <code>getScriptsForWorkerImport</code> method to get the list of scripts you
   would like to import.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <code>addScriptFromErrorWithStackTrace</code> method is implemented according to an approach described
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/19807441/2463642">here</a>. This approach requires an instance of <code>Error</code> class, contains
   which the stack trace when instantiating <code>Error</code>. Thus this function requires an argument of the <code>Error</code> class which
   was instantiated in the correct script.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Practically, to use the ScriptsToImportPool, add two lines in the file contains the proxied class implementation:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/callee-with-import-directive.js"></code></pre>
  
  <p>
   Then you can use it when implementing the proxy:
  </p>
  <pre><code data-src="scripts/proxy-with-import-directive.js"></code></pre>
  
  <input type="button" onclick="demoScriptsToImportPool()" value="Start ScriptsToImportPool demo">
